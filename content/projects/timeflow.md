An educational game on the basics of investment and time management.

*A commissioned work.* The commission was to design and develop a game from scratch to initial release.

Available on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1005930/Timeflow__Life_Sim/).

My first and last full experience with Unity. We laid tracks as the train ran, tweaked mechanics without having a design document, added unplanned features, but the release did happen.
