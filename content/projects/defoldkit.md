An extension for Visual Studio Code to develop games with Defold.

Available on [Github](https://github.com/astrochili/vscode-defold) and [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=astronachos.defold).

Primarily contains the features I need:

- Easy to sync annotatons and settings.
- Run  and debug without open Defold.
- Bundle and deploy to the mobile device.

*Hope to never have to write in TypeScript again, not my taste.*
