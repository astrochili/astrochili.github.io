summary: Forward shading lighting for Defold

A ready-to-use forward shading lighting extension for Defold.

Available on [Github](https://github.com/astrochili/defold-illumination).

An implementation of classic, but not most optimal lighting in 3D space. All the data passed to the shader program as the texture.

I understand that this is a very basic level, but nevertheless, this experience with *GLSL* will definitely come in handy. So it's definitely a part of the journey to release the first 3D game.
