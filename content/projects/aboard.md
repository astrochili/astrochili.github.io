summary: A flight navigator to use on board of an aircraft
---

An offline flight navigator to use on board of an aircraft. Shows to you where do you fly, speed and altitude of your aircraft, passed and remaining time and distance.

The app was created by the [Small Apps](https://smallapps.io/) collective.

Available on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1275999114).

The idea was to make a simple app doing one function well, as much as possible offline.

The main challenge for the app today is the iPhone waterproofing, which has severely reduced the sensitivity of the GPS antenna. As well as aircraft hulls (surprise surprise).
