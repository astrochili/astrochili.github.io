summary: A minimalistic tile-based landscape builder

A minimalistic tile-based landscape builder with handmade pixel-art graphics. There's no gameplay, just a beautiful implementation of relaxing tile joining.

Available to play on [Itch](https://astrochili.itch.io/landscape-tiler).

It was a game jam entry for [MadeWithDefold Jam 2023](https://itch.io/jam/madewithdefold-jam-2023/rate/2071398) and an attempt to figure out the auto-tiling algorithm. At the same time I got to know more about Aseprite and its tools to draw tiles.

As a result, I also wrote [an article](https://astronachos.com/posts/madewithdefold-jam-2023/) on how is was implemented.
