summary: The Ink parser and runtime in Lua
---

The [Ink](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/) language parser and runtime implementation in Lua.

Available on [Github](https://github.com/astrochili/narrator).

Allows to convert Ink scripts to the book and play it as a story. Suitable for interactive fiction games, dialogues and complex narrative stories. Works with any Lua-based game engine.

It uses [LPeg](https://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/lpeg/) patterns to parse Ink scripts. LPeg is a wondrous deep world that you have to carefully dive into to begin to understand it. And then slowly, carefully go to the surface, so as not to break something.
