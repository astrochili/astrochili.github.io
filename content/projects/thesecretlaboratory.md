summary: An interactive story about the laboratory director
---

A short interactive fiction story about the laboratory director.

Available to play on [Itch](https://astrochili.itch.io/the-secret-laboratory).

## Development

It's an entry for [#MadeWithDefold Jam](https://itch.io/jam/madewithdefold-jam/rate/717048).

The idea was to finally try [Narrator](/projects/narrator) in action. The scenario was made up in about one hour, so it's pretty crazy (and funny?). The implementation of card swiping was later upgraded and migrated to the [Cat's Day](/projects/catsday) game.

## Music

Slow background music of piano and saxophone playing from a patiphone. That's how I wanted to sound this visual interactive experience.
