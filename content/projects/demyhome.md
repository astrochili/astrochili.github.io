summary: A bomb defusal map for Counter-Strike
---

Neighbours on the floor of a Soviet-built residential building from 1972 decided to sort out the control over the rubbish chute.

Right, it's a bomb defusal map for *Counter-Strike 1.6*. The lack of furniture makes movement freer, and middle eastern carpets provide better navigation and differentiate the rooms from each other.

Outside the window is rain and a view of the big night city, which lurks with many adventures. But where is the exit?

You can download the [de_myhome.zip](https://github.com/astrochili/astrochili.github.io/blob/storage/de_myhome.zip?raw=true) and unpack it in to the *Maps* folder.
