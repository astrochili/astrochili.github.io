summary: A chillout music track

The first track I finished after learning what chords are and how to build a melody on them. Poor mixing and mastering, but I like the concept and atmosphere.

The fresh summer air away from the city, the beautiful starry sky and the carefree cosmos beyond...

After a while there is also another track about a deep dive into the other opposite of ensless sky - deep water.

*Poseidon*

It was not defined as a separate project as it was done very sketchy. But if I wanted to make an album in a similar style, these tracks would definitely be together, telling the similar stories.

Everything made with *M-Audio KeyRig 49*, *Ableton Live* and plugins I can't remember anymore.
