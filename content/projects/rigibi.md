summary: A color puzzle game for designers and programmers

A puzzle game, where you mix colors in the right order to get the correct shade.

99 handmade levels can be solved using visual senses and understanding of HEX codes. Not easy, but can.

I remember well that release night when I finally made something worthy of appearing in a real marketplace where games make money. Next was my collision with harsh reality.

If you're buying a book called "How to Become an App Store Millionaire", obviously it's not an instruction manual?
