summary: A deathmatch map for Unreal Tournament
---

A small symmetrical arena with themed corners and a meeting place in the centre designed for *Unreal Tournament 99*.

I liked the level design with *Unreal Editor* at that time definitely more than with *Hammer Editor*. And the bots here were pretty smart out of the box.

You can download the [dm-boxhouse.zip](https://github.com/astrochili/astrochili.github.io/blob/storage/dm-boxhouse.zip?raw=true) and unpack it in to the *maps* folder.
