summary: An atmospheric DJ set based on vinyl records

At the moment as musically my attention has become more about creating [IDM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_dance_music). But this vinyl mix and the records involved are still very satisfying to me and reveal an aspect of the magic I was doing it for.

#### Background

For some period of my life I was interested in dance music and DJing. It started from school, where I dissolved in Paul Oakenfold's mixes (where did I get them from?), listened to sunny compilations of Hed Kandi, dreamed about parties in Ibiza.

Then it was deep house, french electro, nu disco, something else. And most importantly, I really started playing and mixing music for people as a DJ. In cafes, in clubs, in bars. Not for a long time, because of the lack of financial motivation, just a couple of years, but I enjoyed it.

I also bought two vinyl turntables with a mixer and finally learnt how to mix records blindly, just by ear.

I loved the idea of buying interesting records and trying to find beautiful combinations and transitions between them. To feel in control of the sound when bringing one record to another in speed. It's a magic.

#### Back to Turntables

At the moment I don't have a lot of space to comfortably put vinyl turntables, but I think I'll come back to it as I love that aesthetic and I still have the record collection.
