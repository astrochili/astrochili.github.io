summary: A tiny deathmatch map for GTA2
---

A compact multiplayer map for GTA2. Disigned for 2-4 players. Maximum density, movement on foot and quick contact with opponents.

You can download the [mini.zip](https://github.com/astrochili/astrochili.github.io/blob/storage/mini.zip?raw=true) and unpack it in to the *Data* folder. The first district will be replaced with a single player version of the map with a basic bot opponent.
