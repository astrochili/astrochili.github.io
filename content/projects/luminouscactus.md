summary: A point-and-click game about life choices
---

A point-and-click game with pre-rendered voxel scenes about the life choices of one man in blue jeans.

Available to download on [Itch](https://astrochili.itch.io/luminous-cactus) for Windows and macOS.

### Development

My first participation in a game jam. I just opened the list of upcoming jams on itch.io and chose this one for some reason —  [The Mystic Western Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/mysticwestern/rate/73824).

It was a film festival in the desert, unknown to me, and one of the tents in which you could play games from the jam. But where am I, and where is this desert...

Most of the time I got into creating voxel scenes with [MagicaVoxel](https://ephtracy.github.io/). I worked so much on graphic details that I had almost no time left for code and sound.

In last days I built the game's scenario player on Unity and did the voice acting. I'll never forget how at 9am, when the sun was already up, I finally finished recording those crazy phrases in a fictional language. So much pain in that voiceover.

### Music

In fact, this short loop has nothing to do with the game. I just sketched it out some time before. I used it because it suits good for the game where you *don't understand anything*.
