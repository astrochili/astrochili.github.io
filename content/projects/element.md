summary: A large map for HoMM III
---

A large symmetric map that for some reason is almost all placed in a dungeon. This has the side effect of the same dungeon backgrounds during battles, regardless of the biome.

Not sure this map is okay, nor do I think I've gone through it even once. However, I remember that *some* Heroes expert made *some* changes to the balance of this map, so maybe it got better after that.

You can download the [element.zip](https://github.com/astrochili/astrochili.github.io/blob/storage/element.zip?raw=true) and unpack it in to the *Maps* folder. The language is Russian, but not important for this map.
