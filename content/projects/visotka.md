summary: A text quest game inspired by Fallout

A text-based game with a non-linear plot in a post-apocalyptic world. This is probably the first full-fledged game in which I participated as a developer.

### Development

Initially, I had the idea of a high-rise building in the midst of an post-apocalyptic ruins, which someone is actively defending for some reason. I wouldn't be lying if I said I dreamed it when I was asleep (really).

But then I found a team of guys who picked up the idea and developed it into a deep, full of details, story.

I didn't get that game to release, though. Something made me leave the project at the very end (about 98%). Probably youth, love. So the official release has already happened without me, thanks to the guys who finished it. Made with Delphi 7.

### Download
