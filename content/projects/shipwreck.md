### Development

Made in 2 days as an entry for [Ludum Dare 49](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/49/shipwreck/) with the theme — *Unstable*. The prototype has lack of levels, as they were literally made in the last hour. But I still hope to turn it into a real game, because I like the mechanics and how it feels.

By the way, it was my first 3D experience with Defold. You ask, where is the 3D? Heh, these wrecks, watch how they naturally bob on the waves!

### Music

The sound of waves (*really just white noise*), sunny island motifs, the romance of sea travel...

*Shipwreck!*
