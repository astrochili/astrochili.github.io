summary: An utility for quick and fair bill splitting

An assistant to quick and fair bill splitting on iOS.

Scan the bill with a photo, assign items to persons, choose who paid the bill, and then the app calculates *who ate how much* and generates a report *who owes to whom*.

Available on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1463622575). The website is hosted as a part of [Small Apps](https://smallapps.io/fairsplit).

The idea for the app came from the occasional need to settle up payments and expenses after an independent corporate party of dozen people.

It seemed to me that since I hadn't found a quality solution, it definitely needed to be created my own app and it would be popular. That was my marketing plan.

After the release of the app, the need for this functionality in my life magically disappeared. But the app has found its popularity in Indonesia.
