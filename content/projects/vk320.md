summary: A music download manager and player for the VK social network
---

An application for macOS to search, listen to and download music from the [VK](https://vk.com) social network.

Public music API has been closed since 2016, so the app doesn't work anymore. At that time, the app had reached over **24,000** authorised users.

The website is [archived](https://romansilin.com/vk320/).
