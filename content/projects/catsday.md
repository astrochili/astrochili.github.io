An interactive story about one furry. Cute kawaii cards with tinder choice mechanics and melodramatic plot. Still a demo.

Available on the [App Store](https://apple.co/3qVmA3o) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.astronachos.kawaii).

### Development

One day three people got together and decided to make a small text game with pretty pictures for a game jam in a month.

Of course, nothing came out in a month, but a start was made. The team turned out to be much busier than expected.

So we gave ourselves to the demo version by reducing the scope. Better to make and release something small but of high quality, than bad or never.

### Music

There is a main theme track with two additional variations. Mostly made with the [Spitfire BBS Symphony Orchestra Discover](https://www.spitfireaudio.com/bbc-symphony-orchestra-discover) library.
