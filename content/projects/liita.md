A physics puzzle game about a balloon that prefers to make less unnecessary movements. Inspired by an old game [Helious](https://www.myabandonware.com/game/helious-1zd).

Available to download on [Itch](https://astrochili.itch.io/love-is-in-the-air) for Windows and macOS.

The prototype was made with *LÖVE* and *Tiled* during 3 weeks as an entry for for [Games Jam Kanobu 2017](https://devgamm.com/moscow2017/ru/games_jam_kanobu/).

Hoping to get to making a real game someday, still like this prototype. It creates a challenge for the player, gets him hooked. But not suitable for a mobile platform — too hardcore.

### Music

A simple soundtrack was written, which is better to listen to in the game with other micro sounds. It's part of a sound environment, not a musical composition.
