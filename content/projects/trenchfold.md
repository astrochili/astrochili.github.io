What is level design today? There’s so much stuff in there, as much as geometry.

But it's so hard to do it all by yourself. Would be nice to find something simple that didn’t require a lot of time and skills. Go back to 00’s mapmaking for *Half-Life* and *Unreal Tournament* with a simple geometry.

I found the TrenchBroom level editor and created this toolkit to use it with Defold. This is another important part of my journey to releasing my first 3D game.
