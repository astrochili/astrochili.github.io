summary: A single-player map with a story for GTA2
---

A single player map for GTA2. On the way out of the airport you are met by a man from Zaibatsu and offered a ride to the headquarters. The story is divided into four days of tasks, with save game in between.

The implementation is different from the standard phone assignments, because here the whole game is always in the state of the story where you are a member of the Zaibatsu Corporation.

You can download the [dullswill.zip](https://github.com/astrochili/astrochili.github.io/blob/storage/dullswill.zip?raw=true) and unpack it in to the *Data* folder to replace the first district. Map texts are in Russian so the map require the "GTA 2: Беспредел" edition to see correct encoding, there is no translation in English.
